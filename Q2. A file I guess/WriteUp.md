# Solving steps
1. You need the [DeepSound](https://github.com/Jpinsoft/DeepSound) tool for this question <br>
<br>

2. Once you have DeepSound installed you have to open the "Bruhlovania.wav" with it, once you do youll see this <br>

<br>

3. You have to click "Extract secret file" and then you get a file called bruh.7z, extract it and you'll get a file called "bruh.exe" (make sure to have [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) installed) <br>
<b>Note: Windows might flag it as a Virus even though it's not, the file is safe and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/face-hh/bruh) (Shout-out to FaceDev) </b> <br>
<br>

4. After that you'll be left with these files <br>

<br>

8. Finally double click the "haha.funny" file again and this time it should open an image (art made by me) <br>
